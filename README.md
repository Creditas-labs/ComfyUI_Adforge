# Use
1. Install [ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started).
1. Install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)

## API Authentication
Some nodes require authentication.
You can authenticate by coping the [.env.example](.env.example) to a new `.env` file under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui_adforge` and setting the variables,
or set the environment variables directly in your system:
``` bash
export API_KEY="your_google_vertex_api_key"
```

All Vertex API nodes use support the authentication methods described in [Google's Gen AI SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai)
